RT-EQcorrscan is also shipped with two
scripts: `real-time-mf.py` and `mf-reactor.py` which provide a command-line
interface for standard operations.  You will likely find that these scripts suffice
for most use-cases.

To use these scripts you will need to set up your configuration and build you
TemplateBank. See the above tutorial for how to use TemplateBanks, and
how to configure RT-EQcorrscan.
