# RT EQcorrscan
## Real-time implementation of EQcorrscan's matched-filter earthquake detection

Holding ground for the project.

# Contributing

At the moment the project is in its infancy, so any help on project direction is
appreciated, but bear with me while I build the barebones.

# Funding

This project is funded by the Earthquake Commission of New Zealand (EQC).
